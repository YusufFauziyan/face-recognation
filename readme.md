# üß† Face Recognition App

A simple real-time face recognition app using Python, OpenCV, and the `face_recognition` library. It uses your webcam to detect and recognize faces based on a folder of known face images.

---

## üöÄ Features

- üì∑ Real-time face detection and recognition from webcam.
- üß† Compares detected faces with pre-encoded known faces.
- üè∑Ô∏è Displays bounding boxes and name labels.
- üñºÔ∏è Easy setup: just drop images of known faces into a folder.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV
- face_recognition
- NumPy

---

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-recognition-app.git
cd face-recognition-app
```

2. **Install the dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note for macOS M1/M2 users:**  
If you encounter issues with installing `dlib` (a dependency of `face_recognition`), install these first:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install boost
pip install dlib
```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ face_recognition_app.py      # Main app script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ known_faces/                 # Folder with known face images
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ john_doe.jpg             # Example: detected as "john_doe"

```

> All images in the `known_faces` folder should contain **only one face**, and the filename (without extension) will be used as the person's name.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. Put the face images into the `known_faces/` directory.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python face_recognition_app.py
```

3. The app will start your webcam and begin detecting faces.
4. Press `q` to quit the program.
